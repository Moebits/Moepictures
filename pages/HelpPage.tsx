                    Moepictures is an image board organized by tags, dedicated exclusively to showcasing the cutest and most moe artworks. While the majority of content is (and will likely be)
                    2d art, we also have many other artforms including animations, music, and 3d models. <br/><br/>

                    The tags on Moepictures use a dash ("-") as a delimeter, but you can also search with spaces because the search can guess what tags you are searching for.
                    If you encounter a problem with this, use dashed versions of the tags. These are examples
                    of valid searches: <br/>

                    Special tag modifiers: <br/>
                    <span className="help-alt">-Tag 1 -Tag 2</span> - Exclude posts containing Tag 1 and Tag 2. <br/>
                    <span className="help-alt">+Tag 1 +Tag 2</span> - Include posts containing either Tag 1 or Tag 2. <br/><br/>

                    Special searches: <br/>
                    <span className="help-alt">pixiv:id</span> - Search for post matching the pixiv id (if it exists). <br/>

                    These are some tags with special uses: <br/>
                    <span className="help-alt">original</span> - the drawing is original, ie. not fanart. <br/>
                    <span className="help-alt">self post</span> - the post was uploaded by its original creator. <br/>

                    In results, posts may have different border colors which mean the following: <br/>

                    Every image uploaded to Moepictures is hashed with a perceptual hash algorithm, and images that look the same should 
                    yield similar hashes irrespective of their resolution. <br/><br/>

                    When you do an image search your upload is perceptually hashed and we try to find a close match. Usually 
                    this is pretty accurate at finding matching images. If you upload a video, song, or 3d model, the hash is only 
                    computed on the first frame, song cover, or model screenshot. <br/><br/>

                    You can also search for images by dragging and dropping an image into the left portion of the webpage.

                    For audio, the pixelate filter will behave as a bitcrusher and will reduce the sample rate of the audio.

                    Although the original upscaler is Waifu2x, better upscalers have come out since. Currently the best upscaler and the 
                    one that we use is REAL-CUGAN with a scale factor of 4x. If the image doesn't have transparency, also turn on "compress to jpg" 
                    in settings and set the JPG quality to at least 95.<br/>

                    Compressing / re-encoding posts is advised for faster loading and better space efficiency. All compressions should be 
                    high quality and should not leave behind any artifacts. <br/><br/>

                    You can download the app that we use for compressing here: <br/>

                    These are the recommended formats for each type of post: <br/>
                    <span className="help-alt">
                    Images ⇾ Progressive JPG or WEBP for transparent images. Avoid AVIF for high decoding time and PNG for massive filesizes. <br/>
                    Animations ⇾ Animated WEBP is preferred over GIF. <br/>
                    Videos ⇾ MP4 with H.264 codec, WEBM with VP9 codec, or MP4 with AV1 codec. Avoid H.265 codec for poor browser support. <br/>
                    Music ⇾ MP3 with cover art. <br/>
                    3D Models ⇾ GLB or FBX. Avoid OBJ, as it needs separate texture loading we don't support. <br/><br/>
                    </span>

                    The compressing settings that we commonly use are quality at 95% with progressive turned on. <br/>

                    Variations of the same image are combined into a single post. You can add a variation to an existing post 
                    by editing it. All variations of an image should be created by the original artist, otherwise it is considered a third party edit instead.
                    If an image has significantly different tags to the main post (eg. different characters), it's better to make it it's own post.

                    Third party edits are modifications to a work not done/endorsed by the original artist. For
                    example, an animation of an artwork done by someone else. Third party edits behave like their own post,
                    and are also added to the original post in a separate section.

                    A tag can have multiple aliases that point to the same result. This is to
                    facilitate better searching for synonyms like "with audio" and "has audio". Unlike tags, aliases can include non-ASCII characters 
                    so it's possible to add an alias in Japanese in order to enable Japanese searching. Existing tags can also be aliased to another tag,
                    but this is an action that will need approval.

                    A tag can have implications which are tags that are automatically added to posts if they don't already exist. For instance, 
                    you can add an implication that the tag "red hat" implies "hat" and any post uploaded containing the "red hat" tag will also be 
                    given the "hat" tag. These are mainly useful to aid in tagging so you don't have to type out all the broader tags.
